    "This is the final layer, and multiple gold databases should exist, each serving its own purposes, such as creating dashboards, AI applications, etc. For this case, this gold database will be utilized to create a Power BI dashboard using a star schema.\n",
    "All data should be prepared as thoroughly as possible, minimizing the need for additional ETL processes in the consumption application. Furthermore, all business rules should be applied, including the more specific ones, as this particular database will be dedicated to a specific project.\n",

    "As with the other layers, it is crucial to emphasize that these notebooks should ultimately be transformed into final notebooks containing only the essential code. These notebooks should be orchestrated by Azure Data Factory (ADF) pipelines or Azure Databricks (ADB) workflows. It is important to acknowledge that loading methods, error handling, logging mechanisms, and data validation checks were not implemented in this scenario, as these processes may vary based on business limitations, goals, data characteristics, and organizational choices. This example does not represent a real project, and the implementation details would depend on specific project requirements. The focus remains on demonstrating the potential structure and considerations for a project of this nature."
