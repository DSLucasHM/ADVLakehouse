    "In this layer, all data should be consumed from the bronze layer, where it undergoes validation to ensure it serves as the most trustworthy source for all future gold databases. The information processed here must be reliable and ready for ad-hoc consumption, enabling users to create new gold databases for AI, analytical purposes, or other specific goals. \n",

    "Business rules that are not universally applicable should be avoided; only those business rules that are broadly useful should be implemented. For instance, a rule to exclude a specific company from all analyses and machine learning models should be enforced. Additionally, as in the bronze table, an ingestion timestamp should be included to track data processing times.\n",

    "Furthermore, it is important to note that these notebooks should ultimately be transformed into final notebooks containing only the essential code. These notebooks should be orchestrated by Azure Data Factory (ADF) pipelines or Azure Databricks (ADB) workflows. However, it should be acknowledged that loading methods, error handling, logging mechanisms, and data validation checks were not implemented in this scenario, as these processes may vary based on business limitations, goals, data characteristics, and organizational choices. This example does not represent a real case, and the implementation details would depend on specific project requirements."
